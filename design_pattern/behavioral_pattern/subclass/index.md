Page dedicated to knowledge related to [subclass design pattern described by by Robert Nystrom in the game programming patterns.](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/subclass-sandbox.html).

## My opinion

Very basic pattern about subclass. The idea is to define intrinsic behavior in a class and extrinsic behavior in a subclass. The subclass can call intrinsic behavior from the parent class but can also define its own extrinsic behavior.
