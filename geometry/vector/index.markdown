Page dedicated to knowledge related to vectors.

A vector is a geometric object defined by:
- **magnitude**
- **direction**
- **orientation**

A vector is frequently represented by an arrow connecting an inital point A to a point B.

### Cross product

#### Definition

The cross product *u* x *v* is defined as a vector *w* that is orthogonal to both *u* and *v*, with a given direction given by the right-hand rule (sens direct). The cross product is defined by the formula

```
u x v = ||u|| * ||v|| * sin(Î¸) * w
```

#### Properties

- Two vectors collinear have a nul cross product
- Two vectors are orthogonal if and only if (si et seulement si) the magnitude of their cross product is equal to the product of their magnitudes
