#### Definition

A Euclidian plane is a Euclidian space of dimension two. A Euclidian plane is defined by a point and a normal vector.

A plane is often defined by the equation:

```
ax + by + cz + d = 0
```

Where `(a,b,c)` are coefficients of the normal vector to the plane and `d` a distance from the origin.
